## utils

* aesSource : I implemented AES from source (and by lookup table).  Wanted a
  better understanding of how it worked and stuff for when I perform Reverse
  Engineering steps.

* simpleFileEncryption : Makes is easy to use OpenSSL to encrypt files.
  Behaves like a copy command for a single file at a time.  Works on both
  Linux and Windows.
