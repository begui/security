This challenge was to create a palindrome (a word that is spelled the same in reverse, like
racecar) from a collection of word fragments.  The contest gave you a server to connect to via
TCP/IP socket.  Once you gave it enough solutions, it would return you the flag for the challenge.

I didn't include the python code, it was pretty much all given to me.  I'm more 
in C/C++, so I implemented my solution there instead, see psolver.cpp.

Example output and palindromes is in output.txt
